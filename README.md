These are some mini python projects that i made for practice:

#Python Projects

1.**Assignment3_Excercise18**

- _a university assignment that calculates signal attenuation due to rainfall and plots the results for different climatic zones._ \*

  2.**Gym.py**

- _a program that will randomly help you decide when to go to the gym._ \*

  3.**lab4.py**

- _a program for a university assignment that calculates the distance between a ground station and a geostationary satellite._ \*

  4.**number guessing game.py**

- _basic number guessing game._ \*

  5.**password_generator.py**

- _a password generator that generates passwords with uppercase letters, digits and special characters with given size._ \*

  6.**Useful_Python_Apps**

- _Some useful apps that i found on the internet._ \*

#Assembly Projects

1.**Ergasia_2_a.asm**

- _Calculates the expression w = (x+y) - (50 + x + y + z - p) using register operations and displays the result._ \*

  2.**Ergasia_2_b.asm**

- _Computes w = (x+y) - ((x+y) + 50 + z - p) with optimized register reuse and outputs the value._ \*

  3.**Ergasia_3_a.asm**

- _Accesses element a[2,2] in a 4x4 matrix, computes its sum/difference with z, and displays the results interactively._ \*

  4.**Ergasia_3_b.asm**

- _Extends Ergasia_3_a to additionally retrieve and display element a[3,1] using direct offset calculation._ \*

  5.**2D_array_average.asm**

- _Calculates the sum and average of a 4x4 integer matrix, handling overflow and displaying results in decimal/hexadecimal._ \*

  6.**Squares_Sum_and_Mean.asm**

- _Computes the sum of squares and mean square for a predefined WORD array using procedural calls._ \*

  7.**Quadratic_Equation_Roots.asm**

- _Solves quadratic equations with real/complex roots based on user-input coefficients, displaying discriminant and solutions._ \*
